function HomePage() {
  return <div>
    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio! This is a single page application!
      I built this using Next.js and deployed it on Vercel. I also used MUI components like the floating action buttons on the bottom right hand corner and icons from Font Awesome.
    </h1>
  </div>
}

export default HomePage
